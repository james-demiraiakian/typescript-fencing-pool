  // Due to issues described in
  // https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest/issues/697 Jest will display a
  // warning about how a worker process failed to exit. Jest is promise aware,
  // so returning promises will work properly. However supertest is not cleaning
  // up properly on promise returns. Using an afterAll with
  // Net.Server.prototype.close doesn't seem to do anything to help. Using it
  // with afterEach causes subsequent tests to fail. This issue has been at
  // large for about a year at time of writing, so it might need some external
  // contributions rather than waiting for the maintainer to get to it.
  // Additionaly there is a related issue
  // https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest/issues/634 with a pull request
  // tied to it https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest/pull/651 which has yet
  // to be merged.
  //
  // I have confirmed that the tests still fail properly if the expectations are
  // fouled up. So these aren't due to dangling promises that deceptively cause
  // tests to pass.
